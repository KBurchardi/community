To get code to run within webadmin, 
create some object with an init method like
the one below.

Then import your object in the webadmin.coffee file,
and add it to the list of modules to load there.

See for instance the databrowser module for examples
of how to incorporate url routing, views, models and
module-specific settings.
###
define( 
  [],
  () ->

    class ExampleModule

      ###
      The init method will get passed an instance of
      ApplicationState, which gives you access to 
      settings and a GraphDatabase instance.
      ###
      init : (applicationState) ->
        # Do things.
